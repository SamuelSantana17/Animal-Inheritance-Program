# Animal-Inheritance-Program

In this project, we will write a program that will create a virtual zoo of animals. This zoo will contain all sorts of information on various different types of animals, such as an their height (in feet), how fast they can move (miles/hour) in different types of environments (land, sky, water), and their unique properties (how high it can jump, how deep it can dive, etc.). The user will input the exact number of animals for our zoo to contain. From this number, the animals that get added to the zoo will be randomly chosen from a selection of four possibilities: Squirrels, Pelicans, Crabs, and Lobsters. Regardless of the random selections, every animal will have all of its information printed out in a clean and organized fashion for easy reading.

This project is going to cover everything from the course in regards to inheritance. This includes code reusability, parent/child class relationships, the "super" and "protected" keywords, overriding, overloading, casting, packages, abstract classes and interfaces. It will also cover topics from previous lectures, such as static/object classes and input error checking.
